## About this project

I usually take all my notes using the code editor, Visual Studio Code, and store it all on github.
The biggest reason why I take my notes this way is because of vscode's vim plugin. I prefer to do
all of my writing with vim keybindings if it is possible and vscode's vim plugin makes that possible.
I was looking for a project to work on in order to improve my skills and thought about the way that
I took notes. I thought that it would be interesting to make a full stack web app of how I currently take
notes so here I am.

<br />

I looked at several applications as references for MarkdownV. Specifically, I took vscode's material ui
palenight theme and tried my best to replicate it with MarkdownV. I also used [Notable](https://notable.app/), another markdown
notetaking application, and [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), a rich text note taking application, as references for most of the design
of my UI.

## Features

### Markdown-based

Github flavored markdown is the format that notes are written in. You can also write math with Katex expressions.

### Vim and VSCode Keybindings

MarkdownV has two editor modes, Vim and VSCode. Please note that there are some restrictions since MarkdownV is web-based and not actually a full fledged code editor like the real vim and vscode. MarkdownV is using Ace Editor under the hood

### Cloud-based

All notes will be stored on the cloud. MarkdownV uses a mongodb database that is hosted with MongoDB Atlas

### Fuzzy Searching

MarkdownV uses fuzzy search for it's searching algorithm. You can search while respecting current filters or globally just like in vscode by using Ctrl-P to bring up the global search menu. When you are searching the text in the results will be highlighted appropriately to reflect the current query

### Preview Screen

MarkdownV lets you preview your markdown while you are writing it with the use of a split window that is adjustable

### Sorting

MarkdownV allows you to sort your notes ascending or descending by title, date created, and date updated

### Tagging and Favorites

MarkdownV allows you to organize your notes with the use of case insensitive tags. You can also star your favorite notes in order for it to appear in the favorites tab

### Full Screen Mode

You can hide the side menus by utilizing full screen mode. During this mode only your editor, top menu, and preview screen (if enabled) will be shown. To navigate to other notes in fullscreen mode, the global search functionality (Ctrl+P) will be very useful here

## Reflection

This project took me about a month to finally get an MVP out that I was satisfied with. I consider this to be my best project by far
and believe it really represent everything I learned in my web development journey. This project was the first time I have
used typescript with React and Node and also the first time I used Next.js. These technologies were not the only ones that I have
used for the first time for this project but since they weren't specific React libraries I wanted to highlight them. The other
notable technologies I used for the first time were: React Query, React Hook Form, Redux, and Passport.js. This was a project
where I wanted to experiment with new technologies so that was why there were so many firsts in that list.

### Typescript

After using typescript for this project, it is now my preferred way to develop with React and Node. The quality of life that typescript
offers just make the developer experience so much better. I really like how typescript lets you know whether you are missing some parameters
on your component or if you are using the wrong type right in your editor. However, the number one thing I like about typescript is the
improved autocompletion/intellisense.

### Next.js and Next.js API Routes

Next.js will definitely be how I develop with React from now on, the standard CRA just doesn't make sense for my projects anymore when
Next.js can do everything it does but better. Unlike CRA, Next.js has routing built in which is a lot more convenient than `react-router`.
Next.js also offers per-page server side rendering and static site generation where CRA only does client side rendering which is terrible
for SEO. Setting up typescript with Next.js is also built in, you don't even have to write your own tsconfig, all you have to do is convert
your js files to ts or tsx and it will set it all up for you after your first `yarn|npm run dev`.

<br />

While I really loved the developer experience of Next.js over CRA I can't say the same for Next API Routes as my backend over express. Initially,
I did not utilize `next-connect` so I had to write weird wrapper functions for my middlewares rather than being able to just do
something like `app.use(middleware)`. I actually wrote my whole backend like this before I finally found out about `next-connect`.
`next-connect` lets you use middleware like how you would use it in express, however even with this I still think the developer
experience with express is better because with Next API Routes you have to use seperate pages for each endpoint. Hover, one big advantage
that Next API Routes over a seperate express server was the ease in deployment. By using api routes you won't have to upkeep a seperate server
for your backend, when you deploy your Next web app on vercel it will automatically turn your api routes to serverless functions for you
without any extra configuration, this saved me a lot of time.

### Redux and React Query

In MarkdownV I only used Redux for the client state, that means I didn't use it to store async data, that I would make fetch requests
to perform CRUD operations on. Instead I utilized React Query to handle this data, also known as my server state. React Query was a joy to use.
It was very convenient, offering things like isLoading, onError. It did many things for you that you would have to had manually do if you used something like Redux to handle your server state.
I could probably have used a light alternative rather than Redux but since I have never used Redux I wanted to use it just for the sake of learning and
also because Redux toolkit made it very easy to setup without having to write too much boilerplate code.
