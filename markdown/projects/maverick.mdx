## About this project

My friend who was a manager at a local Amazon Warehouse had a problem at work that he commisioned me to create a web app
to solve. The problem he had at work was how they kept track of inbound delivery trucks and outbound delivery trucks. Their
current system at the time was to fill out three big whiteboards with the same information. This system was very inefficient
and was prone to human errors since they needed to enter the same information on three seperate whiteboards. My friend
wanted a system where he could input the outbound and inbound information on some kind of user interface and the data
will be shown on three different TVs. To build what he wanted I used React with MaterialUI and styled components to create
the frontend portion of the web app and used Node and Express for the backend and Mongodb to store the data.
Since the data had to be displayed in real time on separate TVs, simple http requests was not enough, therefore I had to use socket.io.
This app greatly increased the efficiency of keeping track of inbound and outbound delivery trucks because rather than having to
fill out three different whiteboards with the same exact information they only had to fill out a single UI and the changes
would reflect in real time on the TVs.
